# Gowler #
Gowler is a bare bones toy web crawler written in Go.
Its not yet polite.

------
This was a toy project for me to learn about goroutines and channels.
I'm happy with what I've learnt from this project, and due to the long duration perhaps, I've lost interest in writing a web crawler.
Although I might just pick it up at a later point in time.
If you come across this file looking for a web crawler in go checkout
